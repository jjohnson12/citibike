# citibike

For the Tableau challenge, I chose to work with the last complete year of Citibiki data (2019). This ended up being 20,551,697 rides, so I chose a random set of 14,999,999 given the limitations of Tableau public.

Data was initially merged and cleaned using Pandas/Python.

I focused my analysis on gender, location and time. An interesting and unexpected trend was that riders that did not disclose their gender tended to be older and ride much longer than declared men and women. Male riders comprise the majority of riders at >2/3 of the pool. The start location for men v women revealed that women rarely initiate rides in Jersey City and Hoboken. This would be interesting to understand -- is it due to safety concerns? Marketing differences?

The time trends follow a somewhat expected pattern with rides being greatest in the late summer and early fall. Day by day rides are greater when the sun is up into the early evening with peaks near morning and evening commute times.

Most rides start and stop in Manhattan near popular regions for entertainment or travel including Grand Central Park, Midtown and Grand Central Station.
